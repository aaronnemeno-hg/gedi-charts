                   <p>Women's representation in our workforce increased to 23.2% in the US. and 24.6% internationally both due to hiring efforts and stronger retention. In the second half of 2021, women left the company at a lower rate than men for the first time in decades. Although our gender representation is on par with the aerospace and defense industry, we are accelerating our investments in the early science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) pipeline to help strengthen diverse representation. In 2021, Boeing engaged with an estimated 2.7 million young women and girls through various STEM programs.</p>

Our racial equity aspirations, Racial Equity Task Force, <a href="#" target="_blank">Business Resource Groups</a> and Inclusion Ambassadors continue to inform our efforts, including the enterprise rollout of bias mitigation training and guidance to inclusive interview teams. In 2021, we gave $1.4 million in charitable grants to HBCUs and have invested $30 million in organizations focused on racial equity and social justice since 2020.</p>

                  <p>Veterans comprise 14.6% of our total workforce. By business unit, the majority of our business is above industry standard when it comes to veteran representation, such as Boeing Global Services which is nearly 11  points above comparable aerospace businesses. In 2021, 18% of our hires were veterans and we aim to continue growing that number, despite attrition. We are proud partners of the Department of Defense SkillBridge program, through which we expect to train and hire hundreds of military veterans. We also recently expanded the U.S. military pay differential when serving out temporary special military duty, and in 2021, donated $13 million to organizations that support veterans and their families.</p>

                 <p>Our Seek, Speak & Listen habits have helped raise awareness and destigmatize disability. As a result, the self-identification participation rate for disability doubled from the previous year to 28%. We will continue educating ourselves and ensuring that teammates of all abilities feel welcome and able to bring their whole selves to work. With expanded programs to hire more neurodiverse talent in 2022, including our Autism at Work program, and efforts to increase accessibility on our commercial airplanes and in our workplaces, we continue to make Boeing better, stronger and more innovative.</p> 
                 <p>In 2021, 28% of eligible employees participated in voluntary self-ID with <span>6.4% of employees identifying as a person with a disability.</span></p>

                 <p>In 2021, our teammates shared that they wanted to self identify in more authentic ways. Now, U.S. teammates can voluntarily and confidentially report their gender identity and sexual orientation. With this step, our goals are to educate, normalize and destigmatize concepts of gender identity and orientation. This also helps Boeing monitor progress towards full inclusion and equity across our teams, and we home to expand self-identification options internationally where it is safe for our teammates to do so. We encourage teammates to self-identify to give us a more accurate understanding of our workforce so we can better support them. Recent improvements based on teammate feedback include reinstating domestic partnership benefits and expanding our gender transition assistance.</p>
                 <p>In 2021 <span>7.1%</span> of eligible employees participated in the gender identity self-ID and <span>6.1%</span> participated in the sexual orientation self-ID.</p>.
